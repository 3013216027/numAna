Provide a interface for drawing function graphics.

This interface is based on [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), and mainly use `svg` for drawing lines o.o

So you should include the tag `<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>` in your page(s) before use the core function that the interface provide :)
